# NG-ZORRO Archive Documentation

This repository serves as an archive for storing build artifacts from previous versions of the ng-zorro-antd official website. It provides a centralized location to preserve historical documentation and examples from different releases of the NG-ZORRO component library.

## Purpose

The ng-zorro-antd project maintains its official documentation website at [https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro.github.io](https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro.github.io). As the project evolves, older versions of the documentation may be updated or replaced. This archive repository ensures that:

- Historical documentation remains accessible
- Developers can reference older API documentation
- Previous examples and demos are preserved
- Version-specific build artifacts are safely stored

## Automated Archiving with GitHub Actions

Use the Github Actions `Archive Version` to automate the archiving process with specific the target version numbers, such as `19.3.x`.
